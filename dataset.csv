".Covid: States told to increase RT-PCR testsThe health secretary, in his letter to states, highlighted the need for maintaining constant vigil over the Covid-19 situation. He asked them to monitor and report district-wise influenza-like illness (ILI) & severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases in all health facilities on a regular basis, including in the Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP) portal, for detecting the early rising trend of cases. States have also been advised to increase the number of RT-PCR tests and send positive samples for genome sequencing to Indian SARS COV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) laboratories to enable timely detection of new variants, if any, in the country. JN.1 was first identified in August and reports suggest it carried significant mutations that may contribute to increased transmissibility and immune-escape ability. JN.1 variant has also been reported in the USA, China, and Singapore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/centre-calls-health-meet-as-covid-rises-in-kerala-10-deaths-this-month/articleshow/106106851.cms

Union health secretary Sudhansh Pant shared details about JN.1 with the additional chief secretary, principal secretary, and secretary (health) of all states/ UTs, with a message to keep up the vigil against emergence of any new clusters of Covid-19 or other respiratory illness for timely action. The information shared by the Union health secretary states that the current laboratory test (RT-PCR) is effective for JN.1 detection. On symptoms and severity in cases involving Covid-19 caused by the new sub-variant, the health secretary, in the annexure shared by the government with the states, says that it is not known whether JN.1 infection produces different symptoms from other variants. According to the government, there is no indication of increased severity from JN.1 or risk posed by the subvariant to public health in comparison to other currently circulating variants",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/centre-calls-health-meet-as-covid-rises-in-kerala-10-deaths-this-month/articleshow/106106851.cms
