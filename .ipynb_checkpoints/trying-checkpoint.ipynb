Daily cases detected in the state have nearly tripled in a week while 10 deaths have been reported from December 1 to 17, as per data sent to the Centre, sources in the state health department said.Of particular concern is JN.1, a new Covid sub-variant recently detected in a 79-year-old woman in Kerala.On December 16, Kerala reported 302 new Covid cases and four deaths, the highest in the latest outbreak. On December 10, Kerala had reported 109 cases.

He asked them to monitor and report district-wise influenza-like illness (ILI) & severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases in all health facilities on a regular basis, including in the Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP) portal, for detecting the early rising trend of cases. States have also been advised to increase the number of RT-PCR tests and send positive samples for genome sequencing to Indian SARS COV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) laboratories to enable timely detection of new variants, if any, in the country. JN.1 was first identified in August and reports suggest it carried significant mutations that may contribute to increased transmissibility and immune-escape ability. JN.1 variant has also been reported in the USA, China, and Singapore\",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/centre-calls-health-meet-as-covid-rises-in-kerala-10-deaths-this-month/articleshow/106106851.cms\\r\\n\". JN.1 variant has also been reported in the USA, China, and Singapore. Union health secretary Sudhansh Pant shared details about JN.1 with the additional chief secretary, principal secretary, and secretary (health) of all states/ UTs, with a message to keep up the vigil against emergence of any new clusters of Covid-19 or other respiratory illness for timely action. The information shared by the Union health secretary states that the current laboratory test (RT-PCR) is effective for JN.1 detection. On symptoms and severity in cases involving Covid-19 caused by the new sub-variant, the health secretary, in the annexure shared by the government with the states, says that it is not known whether JN.1 infection produces different symptoms from other variants. According to the government, there is no indication of increased severity from JN.1 or risk posed by the subvariant to public health in comparison to other currently circulating variants\",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/centre-calls-health-meet-as-covid-rises-in-kerala-10-deaths-this-month/articleshow/106106851.cms\\r\\n\". According to the government, there is no indication of increased severity from JN.1 or risk posed by the subvariant to public health in comparison to other currently circulating variants. Updated Covid-19 vaccines are expected to increase protection against JN.1, as they do for other variants, the government says.

He asked them to monitor and report district-wise influenza-like illness (ILI) & severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases in all health facilities on a regular basis, including in the Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP) portal, for detecting the early rising trend of cases. States have also been advised to increase the number of RT-PCR tests and send positive samples for genome sequencing to Indian SARS COV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) laboratories to enable timely detection of new variants, if any, in the country. JN.1 was first identified in August and reports suggest it carried significant mutations that may contribute to increased transmissibility and immune-escape ability. JN.1 variant has also been reported in the USA, China, and Singapore\",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/centre-calls-health-meet-as-covid-rises-in-kerala-10-deaths-this-month/articleshow/106106851.cms\\r\\n\".

The information shared by the Union health secretary states that the current laboratory test (RT-PCR) is effective for JN.1 detection. On symptoms and severity in cases involving Covid-19 caused by the new sub-variant, the health secretary, in the annexure shared by the government with the states, says that it is not known whether JN.1 infection produces different symptoms from other variants. According to the government, there is no indication of increased severity from JN.1 or risk posed by the subvariant to public health in comparison to other currently circulating variants\",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/centre-calls-health-meet-as-covid-rises-in-kerala-10-deaths-this-month/articleshow/106106851.cms\\r\\n\".
